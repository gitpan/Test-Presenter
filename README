Test::Presenter is a general purpose tool for generating software testing
reports including test run summaries, performance graphs, historical
comparison charts, and diff comparisons.  New types or layouts of
reports can be created using Template-Toolkit.

Tests tend to have a wide diversity in the styles used for their results
files.  Even though they're generally all some form of plain text,
definition of units, column names, and so forth can vary widely from
test to test.  Thus, you should use Test::Parser to render the data from
these different tests into a neutral XML format called TRPI.

TRPI files are very information-rich, but as a consequence they are very
large.  However, since any test's results can be represented in the TRPI
file, it is useful as a generalized interchange format.

From the user's perspective, if Test::Parser and Test::Presenter are used
together, the fact that TRPI is used can be safely ignored; any test
format that Test::Parser understands can "magically" be transformed into
any report style that Test::Presenter supports.

Please see doc/Overview.txt for more details.

For more information on how to use the script, see the
pod documentation via the command
  perldoc Test::Presenter
or, after installation, view the man pages with
  man Test::Presenter

For instructions on how to install the script, see the
