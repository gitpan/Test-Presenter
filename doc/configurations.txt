The configuration files are what gives Test::Presenter it's flexibility.  Due
to this flexibility, however, configuration files are not included in the
source distribution.  Instead, these files must be crafted manually based on
the information needed for results analysis and/or presentation.  See examples
under the examples directory with the module source.

The format of these files is as follows:

    Regular queries from test/data portion:
        config_tag=id
        config_tag<id
        config_tag>id
        config_tag<=id
        config_tag>=id
        config_tag!=id
        <x|y>data=<column_name>                  # Notice no quotes
        <x|y>data=<column_name> and <column_name> = <some value>
        <x|y>data=<column_name> and <column_name> <= <some value>

    Plaintext definitions:
        config_tag="some text"

    Hardcoded queries and "Search and Replace" queries:
        config_tag=y
        config_tag=n
        config_tag<search_field>=y


    Tags are allowed/required based on what type of plot is being done.
    Example from a simple xy-plot:
        xlabel="Processes"
        ylabelid=3
        yunitsid=3
        xdataid=2 or =4 or =6 or =8 or =10
        ydataid=1 or =3 or =5 or =7 or =9
        key_titlekernel=y
        summary=n
        plot_title=y

    Tags for a histogram:
       xlabel, ylabel, xdata, ydata, yunits, plot_title, summary
