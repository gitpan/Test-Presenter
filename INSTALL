Minimum Requirements
--------------------

The MINIMUM software requirements used to execute Test::Presenter successfully
aren't exactly known.  Test::Presenter was designed using the following
software, however, and any versions future to these should work well:

    perl             v5.8.7
    perldoc          v3.14
    berkeley db      v4.3.29
    berkeley dbxml   v2.2.13
    gnuplot          v4.0

The dbxml package is needed for some parts of Test::Presenter.  Unfortunately,
few distros carry this, so you will probably need to install from source
for now.  The source code is available from here:

    http://dev.sleepycat.com/downloads/releasehistorybdbxml.html

NOTE: The Berkeley DBXml installation must be done with perl support enabled.
In other words, build it with this command:

    cd dbxml-*
    ./buildall.sh --enable-perl --enable-dependencies --prefix=/usr

    # On Gentoo, I needed to set CFLAGS, and it installed but did not 
    # work.:(  It might work on a newer version though.
    CFLAGS=-fPIC ./buildall.sh --enable-perl --enable-dependencies --prefix=/usr


Installation
------------

To install Test::Presenter, execute the following commands in the Test-Presenter
folder from the Test-Presenter directory:

 $ perl Makefile.PL
 $ make
 $ make test

It will tell you if your system is missing any perl dependencies.
 # This should probably be done as superuser or root
 $ make install      


If you want to install the script in your own private space, use

 $ perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/home/joeuser \
        INSTALLMAN1DIR=/home/joeuser/man/man1 \
        INSTALLMAN3DIR=/home/joeuser/man/man3      
 $ make
 $ make test
 
 # This can be done as joeuser
 $ make install


Note that `make test` does nothing interesting.


While doing 'perl Makefile.PL', the package may complain about missing perl
packages.  It is HIGHLY recommended that you download any and all necessary
perl modules to ensure that Test::Reporer works properly.


Uninstallation
--------------

Under a user with sufficient permissions and from the program
distribution directory, execute

  perl Makefile.PL

if there isn't a file called Makefile.  Then execute

  make uninstall

This sometimes works, and sometimes it does not.  If it refuses to work,
you can simply remove all files by hand.  Look for the .packlist file
which perl created when installing the software and remove all files you
find in there.
